# Data-science-third-year-project
Welcome to the COMP30780-Data Science in Practice-2022/23 Spring Group Project repository! This repository showcases the collaborative effort and innovative work of our group's third-year project for the course "Data Science in Practice."


# Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a group project focused on analyzing movies and TV shows to predict their box office success and understand the impact of episode/season count and length on TV show ratings, votes, and overall success. The project aims to explore the relationships between various factors and the commercial performance of movies and TV shows, offering insights into what makes a production successful in the entertainment industry.

# Research Questions
Can we predict the box office success of a movie?
Does episode/season count and length impact TV show ratings, votes, and success?
Data Sources
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising information on movies and TV shows, including details such as box office earnings, genre, release date, runtime, and more. The dataset was collected from reliable sources and preprocessed to ensure its quality and usability for analysis.

# Methodology
1. Box Office Success Prediction
To predict the box office success of a movie, the following steps were undertaken:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing values in the movie dataset.
Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features from the available data to improve prediction accuracy.
Model selection: Exploring different machine learning models suitable for regression tasks.
Model training: Training the chosen models on the prepared dataset.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
Box office prediction: Applying the best-performing model to predict the box office success of movies.
2. Impact of Episode/Season Count and Length on TV Show Success
To investigate the influence of episode/season count and length on TV show ratings, votes, and overall success, the following steps were followed:

Data preparation: Preprocessing the TV show dataset and handling any missing or erroneous values.
Exploratory data analysis: Analyzing and visualizing the relationships between episode/season count, length, and various success metrics (ratings, votes, etc.).
Correlation analysis: Determining the degree of correlation between the analyzed factors.
Statistical modeling: Employing statistical techniques to quantify the impact of episode/season count and length on TV show ratings, votes, and success.
